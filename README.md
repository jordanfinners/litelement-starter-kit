# LitElement Starter Kit

I was inspired to create this by the [Polymer Starter Kit](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-starter-kit) as its always been a create place to get started and this was missing from LitElement, so I created this to help get started without working through the config for all the tools.

Its been tested in the Chrome 73, Edge 44, Firefox 66, Safari 12 and IE11.

It lazy loads the pages when they are required, this isn't supported by standard ESLint so we have to use the ``babel-eslint`` parser instead.
It also means that the index.html has to check if the browser supports dynamic imports, for example Firefox doesn't, so we have to load the legacy bundle for these browsers.

## Third-party Packages

This is a starter kit using [LitElement](https://lit-element.polymer-project.org/).

Uses [PageJS](https://visionmedia.github.io/page.js/) for routing, a tiny express inspired router.
This is configured in the app-shell, so can be swapped out if you have a preference.

Uses [Workbox](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/) to generate a service worker at build time.

### Serve
If you want to hot reload you can install the [Polymer-Cli](https://github.com/Polymer/tools/tree/master/packages/cli)
You can then serve it up using the polymer-cli: ``polymer serve --npm``

Some errors will be thrown as the legacy files (these are generated by the build) won't be there when hot reloading.


### Test
Test with: ``npm run test``

Tests are written using [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/), [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/api/bdd/) and [Sinon](https://sinonjs.org/) all installed for you convenience.

These are run using [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/3.0/index.html) using headless chrome provided by [Puppeteer](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/puppeteer/)

The tests are rolled up using a similar build process as used for generating the production build.
To get around an issue with elements being declared multiple times a exclude-dupe-elements file is included, so the tests don't error when defining the same element multiple times, inspired by [this](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-starter-kit/issues/1123#issuecomment-434724376).


### Lint
Lint with: ``npm run lint``

Linting is done with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) extending some standard rules:
- [eslint:recommended](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/)
- [google](https://github.com/google/eslint-config-google)
- [eslint-config-airbnb-base](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb-base)
- [plugin:wc/best-practice](https://github.com/43081j/eslint-plugin-wc)
- [plugin:lit/recommended](https://github.com/43081j/eslint-plugin-lit)

If you're feeling lazy, which I often am, you can run ``npm run lint:fix`` which will try auto fix your eslint issues.


### Build
Build with: ``npm run build``

The app is built with [RollupJS](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en) and [Babel](https://babeljs.io/).

This generated two builds one ES module build for modern browsers, and a legacy build using [SystemJS](https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs) for older ones e.g. IE11.

It will also copy over any required polyfills, images, manifest.json and the minified index.html to the build folder.

It will also generate a service worker for use as well using Workbox.
